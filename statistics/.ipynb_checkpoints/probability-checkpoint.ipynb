    "A trial, experiment or observation is an event with an unknown outcome.  All\n",
    "possible outcomes of the trial are called the sample space, and the particular\n",
    "outcomes being looked for are known as events.  For example, if the trial is\n",
    "flipping a coin the sample space is heads or tails.  If the trial is rolling a\n",
    "six sided die, looking for an odd number, the sample space is\n",
    "`{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}` and the events are `{1, 3, 5}`.  Trials are considered\n",
    "independent if the outcome of one doesn't affect the others, and events are\n",
    "considered mutually exclusive if they cannot occur at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability of an event is always between 0 and 1.  Zero indicates that\n",
    "there is no chance of the event occuring, whilst one means that the event is\n",
    "certain to occur.  Probability statements are usually written as $P(E) = 0.25$,\n",
    "meaning that the probability of event $E$ occuring is 0.25, or 25%.  The\n",
